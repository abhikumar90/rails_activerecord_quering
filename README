belongs_to associations:
-------------------------

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :role
end

class Role < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :person
end

how to use ActiveRecord methods to query your database:

Person.all

along with the SQL that is generated:

SELECT "person".* FROM "person";

and what the resulting data would look like:

id 	name 	  role_id
1 	Wendell 	1
2 	Christie 	1
3 	Eve 	    2

As you can see, we have a few people in our table, each with a role_id that corresponds to the primary key of a row in the roles table.
In addition, roles have a name and a boolean column called billable.
